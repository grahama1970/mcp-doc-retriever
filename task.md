Objective: Develop an MCP-compatible service (mcp-doc-retriever) using FastAPI, packaged in a Docker container. This service will recursively download website content starting from a given URL, storing files in a mirrored site structure (like wget). It uses requests primarily, with automatic Playwright fallback for detected JS-heavy pages. It avoids re-downloading existing files by path unless forced (`--force`), handles common errors, and provides a two-phase search capability across the downloaded content: a fast keyword scan on decoded text, followed by precise selector-based text extraction on candidate pages identified via an index file.

Core Components:

*   API Interface: FastAPI server (/download endpoint, /search endpoint, /health).
*   Downloader Engine: Handles recursive fetching, requests/Playwright auto-fallback, `--no-clobber` (path-based)/`--force` logic, error handling, saving files in mirror structure, maintaining an index file per download job. Must be asynchronous with concurrency limits.
*   Search Engine: Implements the two-phase search using the download job's index file:
    1.  Fast keyword scan on decoded text content of candidate files.
    2.  Precise text extraction using BeautifulSoup (CSS selectors) on candidate files.
*   Input/Output Models: Pydantic models (DownloadRequest, DownloadStatus, SearchRequest, SearchResultItem, SearchResponse, IndexRecord).
*   Containerization: Dockerfile (including playwright install) and docker-compose.yml with volume mapping.
*   Packaging: Standard pyproject.toml and uv for dependency management.
*   File Storage:
    *   Content: `/app/downloads/content/{hostname}/{path}/{filename}.html` (mirrored structure).
    *   Index: `/app/downloads/index/{download_id}.jsonl` (maps URLs to local paths, content MD5, status).
*   Documentation: Sparse download of library docs, specific header comments, inline examples, lessons_learned.json.
*   File Size Limit: <= 500 lines per Python file where feasible.

*   [X] **Task 2.2: Implement Recursive Download Orchestration & Indexing**
    *   Action: Implement main async orchestrator function `start_recursive_download`. Takes start URL, depth, force flag, `download_id`. Creates/opens index file (`/app/downloads/index/{download_id}.jsonl`). Manages queue/set of visited canonical URLs. Calls fetch function (initially `fetch_single_url_requests`). Extracts links, canonicalizes them, checks domain/subdomain policy, checks depth, checks `robots.txt` (`utils.py` helper needed). Appends `IndexRecord` to index file for each attempt (success/failure). Respects concurrency limits (see Task 2.6).
    *   Deliverable: Updated `downloader.py` with recursive orchestration logic, domain/depth checking, `robots.txt` checking helper call, index file writing.
*   [X] **Task 2.3: Implement Playwright Fallback & Auto-Detection**
    *   Action: Implement async function `fetch_single_url_playwright`. Add logic to `start_recursive_download` (or a wrapper around fetch functions) to: a) Use Playwright if `use_playwright=True` from API, b) Automatically retry with Playwright if `fetch_single_url_requests` returns content matching the heuristic (e.g., <1024 chars AND contains `<div id="root">`/`<div id="app">` with little other body). Manage Playwright resources. Update index record on retry/success/failure.
    *   Deliverable: Updated `downloader.py` with `fetch_single_url_playwright` and automatic fallback logic based on heuristic.
*   [X] **Task 2.4: Implement Error Handling & Basic Checks**
    *   Action: Enhance fetch functions and orchestration logic. Handle timeouts. Implement basic login/paywall check heuristic (scan content for "Login", "Sign In", password fields) and update index record status if detected. Log errors clearly. Ensure fetch status (`success`, `failed_request`, `failed_robotstxt`, `failed_paywall`, etc.) is recorded in the index file.
    *   Deliverable: Enhanced `downloader.py` with improved error handling and status reporting in index file.
*   [X] **Task 2.5: Implement Concurrency Control**
    *   Action: Integrate `asyncio.Semaphore` into the recursive download orchestration logic. Use one semaphore for `requests` calls (limit ~10) and a separate one for Playwright calls (limit ~2-4).
    *   Deliverable: Updated `downloader.py` with semaphore-based concurrency limits.
*   [ ] **Task 2.6: Create Downloader Test Script**
    *   Action: Create `scripts/test_download.py` to test the `start_recursive_download` function directly. Requires setting up mock responses or pointing to safe local test URLs. Test recursion depth, force/no-clobber, basic Playwright trigger (manual flag), index file creation/content.
    *   Deliverable: `scripts/test_download.py`.
*   [ ] **Task 2.7: Phase 2 Verification, Demo & Finalization**
    *   **Goal:** Verify downloader logic, including recursion, indexing, fallback, concurrency, and error handling via code review and test script. Demonstrate running `test_download.py` showing mirror structure creation, index file content, and explaining the key logic paths (requests, playwright fallback, concurrency limits).
    *   **Actions:** Review code/tests, perform demo, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Complete Phase 2: Downloader Implementation"`, `git tag v0.2-downloader`, potentially update lessons learned.
    *   **Deliverable:**
        *   `downloader.py` file created with `fetch_single_url_requests` function implementing core downloading logic using `requests`.
        *   Recursive download orchestration logic implemented in `start_recursive_download` function, including domain/depth checking and `robots.txt` handling.
        *   Playwright fallback logic implemented in `fetch_single_url_playwright` and integrated into the download process.
        *   Basic error handling and checks (connection errors, paywall detection) implemented and index record status updated.
        *   Concurrency control using `asyncio.Semaphore` implemented for `requests` and Playwright.

**Phase 3: Searcher Implementation**

*   [ ] **Task 3.1: Implement Fast Keyword Scan**
    *   Action: Create `src/mcp_doc_retriever/searcher.py`. Implement function `scan_files_for_keywords`. Takes list of local file paths, list of scan keywords. For each path, opens file, *decodes HTML content to text* (handle encoding errors gracefully - log/skip), performs case-insensitive keyword search. Returns list of paths that contain *all* keywords.
    *   Deliverable: `searcher.py` with `scan_files_for_keywords` function using decoded text.
*   [ ] **Task 3.2: Implement Precise Selector Extraction (Text Only)**
    *   Action: Implement function `extract_text_with_selector`. Takes a single local file path, CSS selector, optional list of extract keywords. Parses HTML with BeautifulSoup. Finds elements matching selector. Extracts *text content* (`.get_text()`). If extract keywords provided, filters results keeping only those whose text contains *all* extract keywords (case-insensitive). Returns list of extracted text snippets.
    *   Deliverable: `searcher.py` with `extract_text_with_selector` function returning text only.
*   [ ] **Task 3.3: Integrate Two-Phase Search Logic & Index Lookup**
    *   Action: Create main search function `perform_search`. Takes `download_id`, scan keywords, selector, extract keywords. Reads the index file (`/app/downloads/index/{download_id}.jsonl`). Filters records for `fetch_status='success'` to get list of relevant `local_path` values. Calls `scan_files_for_keywords` with these paths. Calls `extract_text_with_selector` for each candidate path returned by the scan. Looks up `original_url` from the index file for each successful extraction. Structures final results as list of `SearchResultItem` (containing `original_url`, `extracted_content`).
    *   Deliverable: Integrated two-phase `perform_search` logic in `searcher.py` using index file lookup.
*   [ ] **Task 3.4: Create Searcher Test Script**
    *   Action: Create `scripts/test_search.py`. Requires sample downloaded files and a corresponding sample index file (`.jsonl`). Test the `perform_search` function: ensure index is read, scan filters correctly, selector extracts text, results include original URL.
    *   Deliverable: `scripts/test_search.py`.
*   [ ] **Task 3.5: Phase 3 Verification, Demo & Finalization**
    *   **Goal:** Verify the search logic via code review and test script.

**Phase 4: API Integration & Containerization**

*   [ ] **Task 4.1: Integrate Downloader with /download Endpoint**
    *   Action: Update `main.py`. Implement `/download` endpoint. Canonicalize input URL, generate `download_id`. Return `{"status": "started", "download_id": "..."}` immediately. Use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` (or similar async pattern) to run the `start_recursive_download` function from `downloader.py` in the background. Pass necessary parameters (URL, depth, force, `download_id`). Handle immediate errors like invalid start URL format.
    *   Deliverable: Functional `/download` endpoint triggering background download task and returning immediate status.
*   [ ] **Task 4.2: Integrate Searcher with /search Endpoint**
    *   Action: Update `main.py`. Implement `/search` endpoint. Takes `SearchRequest`. Checks if index file for `download_id` exists. Calls `perform_search` function from `searcher.py`. Returns `SearchResponse` containing results or appropriate error (e.g., 404 if index not found).
    *   Deliverable: Functional `/search` endpoint calling search logic.
*   [ ] **Task 4.3: Create Dockerfile**
    *   Action: Create `Dockerfile`. Include Python setup, dependency install (`uv sync --frozen`), **`RUN playwright install --with-deps`** (installs browsers and needed OS libs), copy source code, set workdir, define volume mount point `/app/downloads`, expose port 8000, set entrypoint (`uvicorn`). Define `DOWNLOAD_BASE_DIR=/app/downloads`.
    *   Deliverable: `Dockerfile`.
*   [ ] **Task 4.4: Create docker-compose.yml**
    *   Action: Create `docker-compose.yml`. Define `mcp-doc-retriever` service. Build from context. Map ports (e.g., `8001:8000`). Define volume mapping `download_data:/app/downloads` (using a named volume `download_data` is often better than host path).
    *   Deliverable: `docker-compose.yml`.
*   [ ] **Task 4.5: Create API Test Script**
    *   Action: Create `scripts/test_api.py`. Make calls to `/download` (for a small, safe site), wait briefly (since status endpoint is V2), then call `/search` using the returned `download_id`. Verify expected structure of search results. Test `force` flag.
    *   Deliverable: `scripts/test_api.py`.
*   [ ] **Task 4.6: Phase 4 Verification, Demo & Finalization**
    *   **Goal:** Verify API integration and containerization. Review code, Dockerfile, compose file, and API test script results against the containerized service.
