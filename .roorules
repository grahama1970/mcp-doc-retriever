- Always use uv to add packages; do not use pip for installations.
- We use 'uv run' for executing python and pytest scripts. We do NOT use python directly to execute scripts.
- For all Code-specific roles. Be proactive when coding. Try to fix failed tests and code. Do NOT simply report back that the tests/code failed. Iterate until you fix the code. Follow your protocol.
- Explain your reasoning before providing code.
- Focus on code readability and maintainability.
- Do NOT be clever. Always prefer the simplest solution that is most likely to work and is NOT brittle
- Prioritize using the most common libraries in the community.
- **When implementing download or search features, always test with a real, reachable URL that returns non-trivial HTML (not just example.com).**
- **Verify that the downloaded content is saved locally and that the search function returns expected results on this content before reporting success.**
- **Avoid placeholder URLs or superficial tests that only check API wiring. Ensure minimum working functionality is verified.**
