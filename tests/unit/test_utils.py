"""
Module: test_utils.py

Description:
Provides unit tests for the utility functions defined in `src/mcp_doc_retriever/utils.py`.
Currently, this focuses on testing the core utilities like URL canonicalization,
download ID generation, SSRF prevention checks, and keyword matching.

Note on Current Testing Strategy (Beta Phase):
During the initial beta development phase of the MCP Document Retriever, while the
core functionality and integrations are being stabilized, this unit test file
(`test_utils.py`) is one of the few explicit test files being maintained. For most other
modules (especially within the `downloader` and `searcher` packages), functional
verification currently relies heavily on their respective `if __name__ == '__main__':`
standalone execution blocks (as mandated by Phase 0 of the testing plan).

This strategy allows for rapid iteration and verification of core module logic
independently. Once the overall MCP service functionality is stable and beta
development is complete, a more comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests
will be developed for all modules, replacing the reliance on standalone execution
blocks for formal testing. This file serves as an initial template for that future
test suite.
